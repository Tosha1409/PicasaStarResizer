# resizer
Old script that was written for some client who needed program for resizing pictures marked with "star".
I wrote it few years ago, and probably it can be decent example of code, and client was happy. Though in few weeks i had to put
some additional functionality to script.
Written on Python 2.x(most probably ActivePython), and was runned under *NIX(if i remember correctly)
